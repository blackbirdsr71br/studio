# **App Name**: Compose Builder

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop UI: Drag and drop UI components (Jetpack Compose controls) onto a visual design surface.
- Delete Controls: Delete selected UI controls from the design surface.
- Property Panel: Display a property panel that allows users to view and modify properties of the selected UI control.
- Compose Code Generator: Generates the Jetpack Compose code/JSON needed to recreate the designed UI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey reliability and sophistication for developers.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, for a clean, modern design workspace.
- Accent color: Vivid Purple (#9C27B0) to draw attention to important actions and highlight elements.
- Body text and headline Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a machined, neutral look; ideal for user interface and code.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for clean representation of code.
- Use a clean and intuitive layout, with a clear separation of concerns: a design surface, a component library panel, and a property panel.
- Subtle animations to enhance user experience, like highlighting the active component on hover or transitions when opening the property panel.
